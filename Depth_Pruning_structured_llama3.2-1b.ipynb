    "In a Transformer model like this, layers are organized hierarchically: the initial layers (closer to the input) tend to capture basic language patterns (such as syntactic structure, common word combinations, etc.), while the intermediate and final layers refine these representations, capturing higher-order relationships, global coherence, and subtle semantic nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing the initial layers directly undermines the foundation upon which more complex representations are built, leading the model to generate meaningless text sequences. Similarly, removing layers based on weight importance metrics (without considering their position or function) can eliminate layers critical for linguistic cohesion or contextual coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, removing the final layers, while resulting in a loss of some refinement and specialization capabilities, preserves the initial and middle layers that have already learned fundamental language rules and basic word dependencies.\n",

Later, when we evaluate the model's performance using rankings, we will see that it retains a significant portion of its characteristics. Therefore, we are dealing with a model that can deliver very good results after a small fine-tuning process to recover some of the lost capabilities."

    "**BoolQ:** The performance drop is minimal (from 0.64 to 0.63). BoolQ is a dataset of boolean (true/false) questions based on reading comprehension. The fact that the model nearly maintains its performance suggests that the information required to answer these questions is less sensitive to layer removal or that this type of task primarily benefits from more basic language information, which remains intact after pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lambada (OpenAI and Standard):** Here, the performance drop is much more pronounced. For Lambada OpenAI, the score decreases from 0.62 to 0.46, and for Lambada Standard, it drops from 0.53 to 0.11—a drastic reduction. Lambada focuses on predicting the last word in a text, requiring deep contextual understanding and long-term coherence. This result aligns with the earlier test in the notebook, where the model was asked to complete a prompt, and the generated language was not entirely accurate. This difficulty in producing coherent text within a given context negatively impacted its performance in the evaluated task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ARC Easy:** This benchmark also shows a significant decline (from 0.65 to 0.46). ARC Easy is a reasoning benchmark focused on general knowledge and common sense. The removal of layers likely impacted the model's ability to relate information and maintain reasoning chains, resulting in a reduced capacity to select the correct answer."

    "#Conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored how depth pruning works on Llama-3.2 models. Unlike width pruning, there was no need to account for the functioning of the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "After pruning, the model experiences significant degradation in tasks that require greater contextual and semantic reasoning (Lambada, ARC Easy), while its performance on BoolQ, a comparatively simpler task, remains almost unchanged. This suggests that pruning disproportionately affects the parts of the model that facilitate complex understanding and long-term coherence. BoolQ, being simpler or less dependent on these traits, remains relatively stable, whereas tasks that evaluate context and global coherence are severely impacted.\n",
    "\n",
    "As indicated in the paper: What Matters in Transformers? What Matters in Transformers? Not All Attention is Needed. https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15786 the best result is achieved by removing the deepest layers of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have explored two forms of structured pruning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Width pruning: In this approach, neurons from the MLP layers of two model families, DistilGPT and Llama3, were removed. The process of removing neurons from models with GLU architecture works across all families with this structure, such as QWEN, Gemma, or Microsoft Phi.\n",
    "- Depth pruning: Entire blocks were removed from a Llama3 model. This technique can be adapted to all model families.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common point is that we have used very similar methods to decide which elements to remove from the models, based on the absolute weight of the parameters. The next step will involve making these decisions based on metrics generated while the model is running. This will allow us to create models tailored to specific datasets."
