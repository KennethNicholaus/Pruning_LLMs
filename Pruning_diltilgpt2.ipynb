    "# PRUNING\n",
    "## neurons structured width pruning\n",
    "Pruning is an important optimization technique in machine learning that aims to reduce the size of a model without sacrificing much of its accuracy. By removing less important components, pruning not only decreases the computational cost but also makes the model more efficient for deployment, especially on resource-constrained devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be compared to quantization, another optimization technique that reduces the precision of the model's weights, typically converting them from high-precision floating-point numbers to lower-precision representations. While quantization can significantly reduce model size and speed up inference, it does not selectively remove weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, pruning, allows for targeted removal of less important weights or neurons, which can lead to a more efficient reduction in model size while better preserving accuracy. By selecting the weights to eliminate based on their importance scores, pruning provides more control over the model's structure, often making it a more effective approach when aiming for both model compression and high performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of removing specific parts of a model could be debated, but recent studies, such as the one conducted by NVIDIA: [How to Prune and Distill Llama-3.1 8B to an NVIDIA Llama-3.1-Minitron 4B Model](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-to-prune-and-distill-llama-3-1-8b-to-an-nvidia-llama-3-1-minitron-4b-model/), concluding that pruning, combined with fine-tuning techniques applied after pruning, can produce models that are not only more efficient but also more effective in specific domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also you can combine both techniques and quantize a model that has been previousluy pruned.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on **structured width pruning**, where entire neurons are eliminated based on their low importance scores, which are computed using the L1 norm. The assumption is that neurons with lower L1 norm values contribute less to the overall output of the model, allowing for safe removal to enhance efficiency without drastically impacting accuracy."

    "# Conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, a complete pruning process has been applied to a Transformer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pruning process followed is a structured approach that removes specific neurons from the feedforward layers of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in a smaller model compared to the original, while retaining much of its ability to understand data relationships, as the attention layers remain untouched, and its learning capabilities remain intact since no layers were removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neurons eliminated are those deemed less important for the model's output. This method of selecting neurons, without using a dataset, is ideal when the goal is to obtain a model capable of mimicking the base model’s responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was taken into account that the pruning process modified the size of the layers, so the model’s configuration file had to be adjusted accordingly to ensure it continues to function without issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work."

    "There are many different ways to continue building upon the work done. The two main approaches could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a dataset to select the least important neurons. This method allows the model to be adapted to a specific task, reducing its size and potentially increasing efficiency without requiring a subsequent fine-tuning process.\n",
    "* Perform depth pruning by removing entire layers from the model, rather than just specific neurons.\n",
    "* Adapt the approach to a larger and more current model, such as those from Meta's LLaMA family, Google's Gemma, or any other.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to keep in mind that most models undergoing a pruning process are often fine-tuned afterward to regain the effectiveness they might have lost during pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of pruning to apply often depends on the task for which the model is being trained. For instance, one could consider pruning the attention layers if the input prompts are very short and the relationship between the tokens in the prompt is not particularly important, perhaps in tasks like classification or entity recognition.\n"
