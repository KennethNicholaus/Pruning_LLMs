    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook introduces an innovative approach: **Adaptive Attention Bypass, AAB**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows the model to dynamically decide how many attention layers to use based on the complexity of each input prompt. In this way, simple prompts are processed faster and consume fewer resources, while complex prompts maintain maximum quality by using all available layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the attention layer is one of the most redundant within modern models, specially for the bigger models of each family, because they must respond to disproportionate context windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "With AAB, the model will choose the necessary number of layers for each prompt to perform its task. In the case of chatbots, this is especially useful, since at the beginning of the conversation a very low percentage of layers might be used, and as the size of the prompt increases with the entire conversation, the model can incorporate layers until it reaches 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is compatible with already trained models (it does not require retraining) and can be combined with classical structured pruning techniques to maximize efficiency in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we will see how to configure the model to decide how many layers to activate, how it measures the importance of its layers, and how it skips the execution of those that are not necessary for a specific prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology implemented in this notebook follows these key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calibration of layer importance**: A series of prompts are used to measure the relative importance of each attention layer of the model, assigning a score to each based on its contribution to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation of prompt complexity**: For each input prompt, an ultralight, configurable complexity score is calculated, which combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prompt length (number of tokens, normalized).\n",
    "* Semantic diversity (variance of input embeddings).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adaptive assignment of active layers**: Depending on the complexity score and the size of the model, it is determined how many layers should be active, using a parameterized continuous function that avoids abrupt jumps and allows a smooth transition between difficulty levels. The larger the model, the more layers it supports being bypassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic execution**: During inference, only the most important attention layers, considering the prompt score, are executed. The rest are “bypassed,” meaning their computation is omitted to save time and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flexible configuration**: The entire system is controlled by a configuration file (adaptive_config.json) that allows the method to be adapted to different model sizes, domains, and efficiency requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Main uses and advantages.\n",
    "1. Optimization of models for specific sectors.\n",
    "2. Acceleration of inference in production.\n",
    "3. Reduction of model consumption.\n",
    "4. Chatbots and conversational assistants.\n",
    "5. Compatible with other techniques such as Quantization or structured Pruning.\n",
    "6. Does not require recovery through fine-tuning or Knowledge Distillation.\n",

    "# Conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've made it this far, congratulations! This notebook has been by far the most complex, and long, to assemble in the entire Pruning and Optimization section of the Large Language Model Course.\n",
    "\n",
    "After **sweating it out for several days, this notebook introduces, in a simplified way, the first implementation of my approach to adaptive models, which I've called: Adaptive Attention Bypass (AAB)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the general idea of adaptive models already exists, my goal was to bring it down to earth: create something simplified that any \"LLM Engineer\" could understand, modify, and, above all: Create new adaptive models without breaking a sweat!\n",
    "\n",
    "With this first foray into AAB, several noteworthy things have been achieved:\n",
    "* Setting up an AAB system that adapts Llama-3.2 models.\n",
    "* Devising a calibration method to decide which attention layers truly add value and which can be bypassed from time to time. For this, we have used cosine similarity and a few prompts for calibration.\n",
    "* The function that indicates the complexity for each incoming prompt by looking at its word count and the variance of the embeddings.\n",
    "* Modifying the model, changing both its main `forward` and that of each attention layer, so that the adaptation is transparent to the user using the Model.\n",
    "* And the best part: seeing in the tests how the system decides which layers to use and which not to, depending on the prompt! We have already seen that for simple prompts, the model runs a bit faster and still gives a coherent response.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have tried to make the code and explanation of **this version of AAB** as digestible as possible so that everything fits in a notebook and the general idea can be understood in a few hours of study.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AAB** is, so to speak, in its infancy, and this notebook is its introduction to the world. As in any self-respecting research project, a huge part is experimenting, so this is the task that will take the most time in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly, I think the method shows promise. It is very lightweight to implement, both in calibration and in inference. Furthermore, **it does not require any retraining** and can be adjusted with the `adaptive_config.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Works (What's coming for AAB!)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains only a first deep dive into AAB, but there are already several planned next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Taking AAB to New Territories (More and Larger Models)**:\n",
    "    * I'm very curious to see how **this implementation of AAB** performs with other decoder-only models like Mistral (for which there is already a hint in the `detect_model_architecture` code) and perhaps other more exotic ones.\n",
    "    * Testing it with the \"monsters\" of more than 30B or 70B parameters! **This is where I believe attention bypass can make a huge difference in performance**, as demonstrated in works like [\"What matters in transformers? not all attention is needed.\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15786).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Refining Layer Selection: Complexity Level-Specific Activation Masks**:\n",
    "    * A promising line of research is, instead of a single global `layers_by_importance` list, to explore the creation of **multiple `layers_by_importance` lists, each optimized for a specific prompt complexity range or level**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Exploring Advanced Metrics**:\n",
    "    * Investigating alternative or more sophisticated metrics than cosine similarity for calibrating layer importance in **the AAB system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Synergy with Other Optimization Techniques**:\n",
    "    * Studying further how **AAB can be combined** with other techniques such as quantization or different types of structured pruning, looking for potential combined benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Exhaustive and Rigorous Benchmarking**:\n",
    "    * It is essential to establish a robust benchmarking framework to quantitatively measure the savings in latency and resources, as well as the impact on the quality of the model's responses in various tasks and standard NLP benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, **this AAB approach** is a developing project with considerable growth potential. I hope this presentation has sparked your interest and curiosity."
