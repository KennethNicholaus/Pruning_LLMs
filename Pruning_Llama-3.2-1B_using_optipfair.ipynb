These neurons are likely responsible for key decisions, making the model more accurate after pruning. The Variance of Weights method, while useful in some contexts, can retain neurons that may not contribute significantly to the task, leading to less coherent model outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we shouldnâ€™t fall into the trap of assuming that this neuron selection method will work best across all model structures. It works well with Llama models, and this may be due to several factors:\n",
